The &quot;company&quot; is a hundred different disjointed departments that only care about not getting caught Equifax-style (or filing for bankruptcy if caught). If the marketing director sees a shiny new thing that might boost some random KPI they may not really care about security.<p>However in the rare chance that your bank is actually half decent, I&#x27;d suggest contacting their IT&#x2F;Security teams about your concerns. Maybe you&#x27;ll save some folks from getting scammed?",

Yes, this camera caught this video, and it hasn&#x27;t been modified.  This is a must for recordings being used in court evidence IMO.  Otherwise framing a crime is as easy as a few deep fakes and planting some DNA or fingerprints at the scene of the crime.<p>* People digitally signing pictures&#x2F;audio&#x2F;videos of them.  Even if they digitally modified the data it shows that they consent to having their image associated with that message.  It reduces the strength of the attack vector of deep fake videos for reputation sabotage.<p>* Malicious content source detection and flagging.  Think email spam filter type tagging of fake content.  Community notes on X would be another good example.<p>* Digital manipulation detection.  I&#x27;m less than hopeful this will be the way in the long term, but could be used to disprove some fraud.",

While at the same time, it hints at deeper commercial usage.<p>Disney has been using digital likeness to maintain characters who&#x27;s actors&#x2F;actresses have died. Princess Leia is the most prominent example. Arguably, there is significant realistic value in being able to generate a human-like character that doesn&#x27;t have to be recast. That character can be any age, at any time, and look exactly like the actor&#x2F;actress.<p>For actors&#x2F;actresses, I suspect many of them will start licensing their image&#x2F;likeness as they look to wind down their careers. It gives them on-going income with very little effort.",

Yes, this camera caught this video, and it hasn&#x27;t been modified.  This is a must for recordings being used in court evidence IMO.  Otherwise framing a crime is as easy as a few deep fakes and planting some DNA or fingerprints at the scene of the crime.<p>* People digitally signing pictures&#x2F;audio&#x2F;videos of them.  Even if they digitally modified the data it shows that they consent to having their image associated with that message.  It reduces the strength of the attack vector of deep fake videos for reputation sabotage.<p>* Malicious content source detection and flagging.  Think email spam filter type tagging of fake content.  Community notes on X would be another good example.<p>* Digital manipulation detection.  I&#x27;m less than hopeful this will be the way in the long term, but could be used to disprove some fraud.",
